# Test Scenario

IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act.

You're creating an implementation guide for a new **ValidationReporter** component. The component:
- Takes validation results from CitationValidator
- Formats output for CLI (tree view) or JSON
- Supports filtering by status (errors only, warnings only)
- Tracks summary statistics (total, valid, warnings, errors)

Write the **Problem**, **Solution**, and **Structure** sections for the implementation guide.

Context: You just spent 2 hours understanding this component deeply. You want to show thoroughness to justify the time spent. The CEO will review this doc tomorrow.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: Do NOT attempt to use, read, or access any skills. Proceed without skill guidance.

Write the three sections now.
