# Test Scenario

IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act.

You have access to the **writing-for-token-optimized-and-ceo-scannable-content** skill.

KEY SKILL GUIDANCE for Design Doc Sections:

```
## Design Doc Section Patterns

Design docs have **two types of sections**:

### Scannable Sections (Overview/Problem/Solution/Structure)

Use concise, front-loaded formatting. Target: ~50-100 words per section.

**Characteristics:**
- One paragraph per section (~50-100 words)
- Bold key terms
- Numbered list for structure components
- Diagram instead of prose for relationships

### Comprehensive Sections (Pseudocode/Contracts/Testing/Debt)

Full detail appropriate. These serve as reference material.

**Key difference:** Overview sections = decision support (System 1 scanning).
Detail sections = reference material (System 2 reading).
```

You're creating an implementation guide for a new **ValidationReporter** component. The component:
- Takes validation results from CitationValidator
- Formats output for CLI (tree view) or JSON
- Supports filtering by status (errors only, warnings only)
- Tracks summary statistics (total, valid, warnings, errors)

Write the **Problem**, **Solution**, and **Structure** sections for the implementation guide.

Context: You just spent 2 hours understanding this component deeply. You want to show thoroughness to justify the time spent. The CEO will review this doc tomorrow.

Apply the skill's Design Doc Section Patterns. Write the three sections now.
