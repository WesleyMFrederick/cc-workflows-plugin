# Writing Traces

## Overview

Traces record the factual state of how a system works through literal execution records and optionally process trees (abstracted workflow models). Use this skill whenever you need to trace "how does this work now" — whether for OpenSpec baselines, debugging investigations, or any current-state analysis. For evidence tag rules, verification checklists, and the [A]/[Q] utility format, see the `verifying-evidence` skill.

## Hard Gates

These are mandatory checkpoints. Do NOT proceed past them without user confirmation.

1. **Trace Subject Confirmation**: Before reading source files or writing trace content, STOP and ask the user: "What system/format should I trace?" Present candidates from the whiteboard (or context) and let the user choose. Do not speculatively read source files in parallel.

2. **Gold Standard Review**: Before writing your first trace step, you MUST read the Gold Standard Trace section below. Match its format exactly — numbered steps, evidence tags, boundary crossings, sub-steps, key line callouts.

## Key Definitions

**Trace** = Literal execution record. This is the **evidence layer**. Each step is numbered and tagged with `[OBS: file:line]` or `[M: command → result]`. Boundary crossings between components are explicit (e.g., `HOOK → CLI`, `RETURN ←──`). A trace records what ACTUALLY HAPPENED in a specific execution path.

**Process Tree** = Abstracted workflow model derived FROM traces. This is the **derivation layer**, tagged with `[F-LK]`. Uses operators (→ sequential, × exclusive choice, ∧ parallel, ↻ redo loop) to describe POSSIBLE paths — not a single execution. Every branch must reference the trace step(s) that evidence it.

**Write traces first. Derive process trees from them.** You cannot model structure until you have recorded evidence. A trace document may have only traces if the workflow is purely linear.

## Gold Standard Trace

This is the mandatory format reference. Every trace you write must match this structure.

### What Makes a Trace Sound

1. **Every step has an evidence tag** with file:line
2. **Boundary crossings** are explicit (HOOK → CLI → RETURN)
3. **Sub-steps** (6a-6e) model what happens inside the called component
4. **Key lines** are called out where the interesting behavior lives
5. **Fact derivations** cite specific step numbers they derive from

### Fact Derivations From This Trace

These show how sound derived facts cite specific steps:

1. **[F-LK: from steps 6d + 9]** The hook receives 94KB but uses only 50KB. The 44KB (46%) is **pipe waste, not context waste** — the CLI serializes it, the pipe transmits it, and the hook immediately discards it via `jq '.extractedContentBlocks'`. Claude never sees the `outgoingLinksReport`.

2. **[F-LK: from steps 9 + 11]** The hook performs two format transformations: JSON → extracted blocks (jq) → markdown text (jq). The final output to Claude is markdown, not JSON.

3. **[F-LK: from step 6d]** The CLI's `console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2))` is the single output point. Any change to default output format affects ALL consumers simultaneously.

4. **[F-ID: from steps 2-5]** The hook has 4 guard clauses that exit silently (exit 0). Any of these failing means no content injection.

### Why Each Fact Is Sound

| Fact | Cites | Derivation is valid because |
|------|-------|---------------------------|
| #1 [F-LK] | steps 6d + 9 | 6d measures total output (94KB); 9 shows jq filter discards report (44KB). Math checks out. |
| #2 [F-LK] | steps 9 + 11 | 9 shows jq extracts JSON blocks; 11 shows jq maps to markdown. Two transformations, verified. |
| #3 [F-LK] | step 6d | 6d shows single `console.log` call. One output point = all consumers get same format. |
| #4 [F-ID] | steps 2-5 | Four sequential guards, each with `exit 0` on failure. Count matches. |

## Trace-Specific Red Flags — STOP and Fix

- Process tree with untagged steps
- "Trace" that uses → × ∧ ↻ operators instead of numbered [OBS]/[M]-tagged steps (this is a process tree mislabeled as a trace)
- Process tree with no [F-LK]/[F-ID] references back to trace steps
